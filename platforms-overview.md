## Key Platform Considerations:
- **Browser Extensions**: Focus on permissions, cross-browser compatibility, lightweight and responsive UI, and ease of installation.
- **VSCode Extensions**: Integrate smoothly into the IDE, prioritize functionality, and maintain consistency with VSCode's user experience.
- **Photoshop Extensions**: Maximize compatibility with Photoshop, use native UI components, and ensure the extension does not interrupt the user’s workflow.
- **Mobile (iOS & Android) Extensions**: Adhere to platform-specific guidelines, focus on mobile usability, and test across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Game Modding (Unity, Minecraft)**: Maintain high compatibility with game engines, consider performance and stability for game modding.
- **Cloud Extensions**: Focus on scalability, event handling, and efficient cloud resources, especially for serverless functions.
- **Desktop Extensions**: Ensure cross-platform compatibility (e.g., Windows/macOS), maintain a lightweight footprint, and ensure stability with system resources.
